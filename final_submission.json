        "description":  "We developed a metadata catalog to help the query optimizer in modern OLAP systems, which need efficient metadata management for analytic queries. Our Rust application uses RocksDB for metadata storage, exposing a REST API for interaction. The architecture includes a data model, database, service, and controller layers, ensuring seamless metadata management. RocksDB's key-value store, chosen for its concurrency and scalability, outperformed SQLite for our needs. Axum powers our REST API for efficient asynchronous operations. Testing ensures the catalog's correctness and performance, with a design focused on optimizing read performance over frequent updates.",
